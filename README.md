# Project 1: Lo-Fi Tetris

## Overview
This was the first project for the Software Engineering Immersive course with GA. We were given a timeline of one week to pick a game from a list of options then re-create it, and I chose Tetris. I found the solo project to be an incredible learning experience in brainstorming, designing, then executing a project from start to finish, and I learned many valuable lessons along the way.

You can find the deployed version of my game here: [Lo-Fi Tetris](https://jacqizee.github.io/Lo-Fi-Tetris/)

## The Brief

**Timeframe:**
* 7 days

**General Project Brief:**
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS

**Tetris-Specific Brief:**
* The game should stop if a Tetrimino fills the highest row of the game board
* The player should be able to rotate each Tetrimino about its own axis
* If a line is completed it should be removed and the pieces above should take its place

## Technologies Used
**Languages:**
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* HTML5 & HTML5 Audio
* CSS3

**Dev Tools:**
* VSCode
* Eslint
* Git
* GitHub
* Google Fonts
* Google Chrome Dev Tools

## Controls & Features
* Start Button
* Key Up - Rotates the Tetromino
* Key Down - Lowers Tetromino
* Key Left/Right - Moves the Tetromino Left/Right
* Reset Button
* Audio & Audio Controls
* Persistent High Score Using Local Storage
* Speed Increases as Player Levels Up

## Instructions
* Tetris is a puzzle game where the player has to fit different shaped blocks (called Tetriminos) together so that they make a complete line across the playing board. Once a line is achieved it is removed from the game board and the player's score is increased
* The player can move the Tetriminos left and right and rotate them clockwise in 90ยบ increments
* The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible before the game board is filled with Tetriminos

## Approach
Selecting Tetris as my game of choice for the project definitely put me way outside my comfort zone, but I selected it to push myself to see if I could rise to the daunting challenge within a week. I personally also really enjoy playing Tetris, so was particularly drawn and eager to recreate it.

### Planning: Wireframing and Pseudocode

Before jumping into coding, I played several different versions of Tetris online to remind myself of the gameplay and to note features available that I would want to replicate for my game. From there, I drew out a wireframe to map the different semantic and non-semantic HTML elements, then moved into pseudocoding how I thought I should approach the problem.

Despite itching to jump into coding, I spent the entire first day on pseudocode to plan out my approach to the project, as I felt if I skipped/rushed this step I was bound to hit many roadblocks. Initally I mapped out that I would need:
* An interval which lowers the active tetromino by one row every second or so. The interval would need to check if the piece could be lowered, and if not i.e. reaching the bottom of the grid or another tetromino piece, freeze the tetromino in place.
* To randomly generate a tetromino and be able to move it left, right, and down as it falls down the board
* To clear rows when full, shifting all elements above the row down
* And to end the game when there is no room for a new tetromino to drop

Once I had mapped out a plan for how I planned to approach each item listed, I allowed myself to get cracking on the coding.

### Grid Creation

To start, I wrote up the HTML for the game based off my wireframe, then used JavaScript and DOM manipulation to both create the main grid and mini grid for the game, storing each div created as a cell within an array. Afted adding a sprinkling of basic CSS, I was ready to start writing functions.

### Creating and Generating Tetronimos

To create and generate tetronimos in JavaScript, I created a class that would allow me to easily create objects and assign values for their different attributes. Initially, I had a single array that I used to store the Tetronimos, and would access each Tetronimo via a randomly generated number from 0 to 6.

```
  class Tetromino {
    constructor(startingPosition, shape) {
      this.currentPosition = startingPosition,
      this.startingPosition = startingPosition,
      this.nextPosition = [],
      this.active = shape + '-active',
      this.inactive = shape + '-paused'
    }
  }

const tetrominoO = new Tetromino([4, 5, 14, 15], 'red')
..
...
const tetrominoI = new Tetromino([3, 4, 5, 6], 'violet')
const allTetrominos = [tetrominoO, tetrominoL, tetrominoJ, tetrominoT, tetrominoZ, tetrominoS, tetrominoI]

nextShape === null ? currentTetro = allTetrominos[Math.floor((Math.random() * 7))] : currentTetro = nextTetro
nextShape = allTetrominos[Math.floor((Math.random() * 7))]
```

Later on, I removed this static array and instead generated a new tetronimo object and re-assigned it to `currentTetro`. This was cleaner than re-using the same objects, and saved me from having to re-set any object values. I used a switch statement function as it was more readable and cleaner than multiple if .. else statements.

```
  function generateTetro() {
    switch (Math.floor((Math.random() * 7))) {
      case 0:
        return new Tetromino([4, 5, 14, 15], 'o')
      case 1:
        return new Tetromino([4, 14, 24, 25], 'l')
      case 2:
        return new Tetromino([5, 15, 24, 25], 'j')
      case 3:
        return new Tetromino([4, 13, 14, 15], 't')
      case 4:
        return new Tetromino([4, 5, 15, 16], 'z')
      case 5:
        return new Tetromino([4, 5, 13, 14], 's')
      case 6:
        return new Tetromino([3, 4, 5, 6], 'i')
    }
  }

nextTetro === null ? currentTetro = generateTetro() : currentTetro = nextTetro
nextTetro = generateTetro()
```

### Dropping the Tetronimo

To drop a tetronimo and move it down the screen, I used a setTimeout interval. In contrast to setInterval, I knew setTimeout would allow me to more easily update the speed of the tetronimo drop/interval as the player levels up. Outside of just moving the active tetronimo, this interval was also where a lot of the heavy lifting was executed: 
* Generating new tetronimos
* Generating the upcoming tetronimo and displaying it in the mini grid
* Checking whether the game should end (if no space for a new tetronimo)
* Checking if any lines needed to be cleared when the tetronimo reaches the bottom

To know which tetronimo to move (or whether to generate and drop a new one), I classed tetronimo cells as either 'active' or 'paused'. At the start of the interval if active cells were present, that would signal to move that shape down a row. If active cells were absent, then it would signal that we needed to generate a new shape and drop it from the top. Checks in place would be validated throughout.

### Tetronimo Horizontal Movement

To allow the user to be able to move tetronimos horizontally, I had to be conscious of was movement that would wrap the tetronimo on the left or right edges of the grid, and any movement into an existing tetronimo. To prevent this, I used if .. statements that blocked movement left/right if the shape was at all present in the left/right-most column, or if its new position already contains a paused cell.

## Future Features

If I had more time, these are the features I would have loved to incorporate next:
* Hard Drop for Tetronimos - this is a common feature in Tetris that I certainly do miss in my game. My approach would be to check the columns the current shape is in, then find which row has the highest paused cell. From there, I would lower the current shape to just above that row by adding to the currentPosition array.
* Counter-Clockwise Rotation - I have most of the checks in place already with my current rotation function, I think if I had time I would have allowed for rotation both directions.
* Color-Blind Mode - More of a styling/DOM manipulation challenge, but I would have loved to have had a button that would allow a user to toggle color-blind friendly tetronimo colors.
